The title of my booklet is "The Art of Crafting Deep Learning".
I decide to write this booklet to really make myself grasp the philosophy and craftmanship of deep learning, the machine learning field that continues to make technical breakthroughs (e.g. Large Language Models) and leverage world-changing products (e.g. ChatGPT).
However, as said by [xxx], the field is advancing by continuous optimization improvements, inductive bias innovations and scaling up that are separately conducted by different individuals and groups within the whole community.
And no one can grasp the motivation and reasoning behind these historically distributed byt systemantic exploration as a whole.
This booklet is aiming to provide a biased perspective on my effort for achieving the above goal.

I would like to first survey several introductory books about deep learning, an non-exhaustive list is the following:
- "Deep Learning", Ian Goodfellow et al. 2016.
- "Dive into Deep Learning", Aston Zhang, 2021.
- "The Little Book of Deep Learning", Francois Fleuret, 2023.
- "Understanding Deep Learning", Simon J. D. Prince, 2023.
- "Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts", Chris Bishop et al. 2024.
